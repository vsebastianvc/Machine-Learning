## About Experiment 

In our experiment with feature selection we started with the data available in UCI, with information from 6 subjects (6 different persons) who tied to their waist a common smartphone and recorded the gyroscope and accelerometer measures, doing the 6 different activities: walking, siting, laying, upstairs, downstairs and standing. This information already was classified into that 6 different activities and presented in two different files: a train and a test file.

We explored several Machine Learning algorithms including: K-nearest neighbor, Logistic Regression, SGD, SVM, Keras Neural Network and Random Forrest; and reproduced the classification with a good accuracy in a common laptop but, the best algorithm was Random Forrest with an acceptable accuracy of 91%.
